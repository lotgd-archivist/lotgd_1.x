## Legend of the Green Dragon 1.x

This repository contains the version history, as I could restore it, from 1.0 to the final 1.1.2 DragonPrime edition.

## Important notice

This repository is for archival purposes only. I strongly recommend against running these versions. Many of them have known security issues.

If you want to run a 1.x LotGD server, I recommend checking out the the [+nb fork](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd).

Version 1.0.6+classic+jt+ext is wholy incompatible with other 1.x.x versions and JT Traub asked me to make that very clear. [Please refer to the notes in that folder](1.0.6%2Bclassic%2Bjt%2Bext/_ArchivistNotes.md).

## Archivist note:

The versions 1.0.6, 1.1.0 I could not yet verify as being unmodified / as released. They were thankfully provided to me from a private archive. 

Version 1.1.1 was provided to me in 3 different states. I am reasonably certain that 1.1.1_beta is the beta version as it was released and 1.1.1_dragonprime is the unmodified full release version.
