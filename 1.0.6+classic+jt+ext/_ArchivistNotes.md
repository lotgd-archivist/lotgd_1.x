## README

This is version "1.0.6+classic+jt+ext" maintained by JT Traub and running on https://logd.dragoncat.net. He graceiously shared this version for me with permission for public archival.

He asked me to add that nobody should attempt to run this code. In his words:

``` 
I *strongly* ask that noone attempt to run this code as is, solely because I know that it just won't work as is any longer, however, [you] are welcome to make use of it as reference.
```

He said that he made extensive fixes to make the game work with MySQL 8, a lot of which done in database. Those fixes were never formalized into a DB update file and thus making this version of the game wholy incompatible with other 1.x.x versions.

This snapshot of his private repository was obtained on 2022-08-22.

I have redacted some sensitive information in the code. You an find these redactions annotated in square brackets: `[redacted by archivist]`
